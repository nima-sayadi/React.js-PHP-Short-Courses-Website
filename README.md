This school project was an unfinished project that was written in next.js(react.js) as front end and PHP as backend. No backend frameworks were used for PHP. You can finish the project yourself and enjoy learning PHP and next.js(react.js). Who knows maybe this project will even make you some $$$ üòÅ. Some nice CSS and JS animations were used in this project so make the most of it !

Last but not least, This project was completely made by me.

Remember, Coding is a passion üíì Good luck ‚úå
